Accepted

Context
*******

We need a way to track when learners home completed content that can't be easily
track by some other mechanism or where we want the learner to conciously mark
that they have finished some piece of work.  For example, if there is a piece of
reading that we want to ensure is done.

Decision
********

Create an `XBlock`_ to allow learners to be able to click a button to confirm
that they have completed some work.

Consequences
************

We create this new repo to house this simple `XBlock`_
